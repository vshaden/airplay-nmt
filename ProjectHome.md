Now can be installed with CSI. See here:

It is now in the default repositories, so just select Airplay-nmt to install.

It should advertise a bonjour airplay service called NMT.
You should then be able to play a video in standard video player app on iPhone/iPhone/iPad (requires iOS 4.2.1) and select NMT from the airplay menu.

Consider this beta. It may or may not work.
This has been tested on a C200 and A110. I imagine it will work on a A200/A210, and A100.
It uses TheDavidBox API on C200 type devices, and /tmp/gaya\_bc on A100 type devices. It may work on other NMTs if they support these interfaces.

Should now support iOS 4.3
